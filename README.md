# Bitshift

Thibault Brevet, 2015.

Bitshift explores the physical manifestation of information. An array of black 10x10cm PCBs is arranged horizontally against the wall. An input signal is sent through the left-most module. As the signalling bit shifts from one module to another, it triggers an optical change in the devices. Embedded in the Printed Circuit Boards are resistive heating zones coated with a thermochromic agent. As the boards warm up they initiate a change in the pigment, the black top-coat reveals the white surface underneath for a brief moment, and then forwards the signal down the chain. As the boards cool down they fade back to black.

This project has been produced in the context of [Re-programmed art: an open manifesto](http://www.reprogrammed-art.cc/).
