# Bitshift

Thibault Brevet, 2015.

Bitshift explores the physical manifestation of information. As the signalling bit shifts from one module to another, it triggers an optical change in the devices. Embedded in the Printed Circuit Boards are resistive heating zones coated with a thermochromic agent. As the boards warm up they initiate a change in the pigment, the black top-coat reveals the white surface underneath for a brief moment, and then forwards the signal down the chain. As the boards cool down they hide back their internals.

This project has been produced in the context of [Re-programmed art: an open manifesto](http://www.reprogrammed-art.cc/).
